Microsoft Trial -- The Gates Deposition: 684 Pages Of Conflict
By James V. Grimaldi
Seattle Times Washington Bureau

MICROSOFT SAID LAWYERS for the government have used "snippets" of testimony to make Bill Gates look bad in the antitrust case. A review of his entire deposition shows that throughout, Gates quibbled, dodged, shot sarcastic comments - and stuck to his guns.

WASHINGTON - At one point in his confrontation with antitrust enforcers last summer, an exasperated Bill Gates vented his frustration at the relentless questioning.

"You," the Microsoft chairman told the government's interrogator, "don't seem to like the facts!"

A Seattle Times review of the entire transcript of the now-famous deposition of Gates reveals the intense, bitter and dramatic struggle between the opponents in the historic antitrust trial under way in federal court in Washington, D.C.

When the government first played videotaped excerpts of the pretrial questioning after the trial began in October, the company denounced the tactic as an unfair use of out-of-context "snippets."

But a look at the 684-page transcript reveals that the government has accurately portrayed the excerpts. At the same time, it details the titanic struggle between the world's richest man and antitrust enforcers persistently attempting to pry details to help their case.

The deposition also reinforces the steadfastness with which Gates stuck to the software company's business explanations for activities the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states now say were illegal. And it foreshadowed the defiant testimony of the Microsoft's executives who appeared on the witness stand in U.S. District Court.

When Gates gave answers to questions that chief government litigator David Boies didn't like, the experienced trial lawyer would rephrase the question, sometimes dozens of times, to wrest an answer.

Gates also set the tone in his deposition for his executives in another way, dodging questions and quibbling with words - a tactic far less successful in court, where U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has little tolerance for semantic debates and often cuts short such evasiveness with sharp questioning of his own.

About eight hours of the deposition, selected by both the government and Microsoft, have been made public in federal court since the trial began in October.

But the rest of the pretrial questioning is about to be unsealed; the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Jan. 29 that the deposition is a public record and should have been open to the public. Microsoft has declined to seek further appeal.

What's new

Among the new material in the deposition transcript, Gates:

-- Testified that IBM pays more for licensing the Windows operating system than other computer manufacturers because the Armonk, N.Y., company declined to participate in some marketing programs.

-- Denied allegations that Microsoft tried to collude with Apple Computer and RealNetworks by attempting to divide the market for software that plays audio and video over the Internet.

-- Expressed surprise at the Senate Judiciary Committee testimony of RealNetworks Chief Executive Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive. Gates said he had never considered Glaser a competitor until "he went out of his way to lie about us." After Glaser's appearance, "I sort of thought, `Hmm, he must be a competitor.' "

-- Repeated many of the Microsoft defenses, now familiar after more than four months of trial, for various activities under scrutiny. When confronted with contradictory documents, e-mail and evidence, Gates didn't budge from his version of events.

-- Said he deletes 98 percent of his e-mail messages, asserting that neither he nor Microsoft's public-relations firm, Waggoner Edstrom, has ever intentionally deleted documents sought by the government relating to Microsoft's competitors.

200 `I don't knows'

The combative deposition spanned 20 hours and was taken Aug. 28 and 29 and Sept. 2 at Microsoft's corporate campus in Redmond.

While the deposition has been widely seen as a problem for Microsoft, Gates treated it nonchalantly while it was under way. Between the second and third days of questioning, Gates even attended a star-studded birthday cruise thrown by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft.

When he returned, Gates described for questioners what he had said on the trip.

"I can recall some people saying, `Must have been rough,' and my saying, `Well, it's like depositions I've been in before,' " Gates said.

One notable point in the deposition is Gates' apparent lack of forthrightness, which already could have damaged his credibility with Jackson, who called his deposition "troubling."

The portions of the deposition that have not been disclosed publicly are unlikely to reverse the impression of obfuscation the government has described as "an astonishing lack of recall."

The famously hands-on Microsoft chief answered deposition questions with "I don't know," "I don't remember" or "I don't recall" more than 200 times.

Sarcastic exchanges

But the transcript does shed some more light on the performance of Boies and New York antitrust attorney Stephen Houck, who both responded with like-minded stubbornness and often matched Gates' notorious sarcasm with equally dismissive comments.

"Aren't you just trying to substitute different words for the word that you actually wrote that you think will sound better in the context of this litigation?" Boies asked at one point. When Boies persisted, asking Gates whether he would be more comfortable if the e-mail were characterized another way, Gates barked back: "I've never been comfortable with lawyers mischaracterizing the truth."

At another point, Gates responded to a question saying, "If I realized how you might misinterpret the thing, I would have put a little footnote in here for you to help make sure you didn't misinterpret it."

Boies and Houck reminded Gates nine times that he was under oath and began questions with "Is it your testimony" more than 20 times, sometimes adding, "as you sit here under oath." They wielded the phrase with the implication that the previous comment was an error or misleading, as if to say, "You don't expect us to believe that, do you?"

In other parts, Boies and Houck seemed somewhat confused by either the technology or Gates' efforts to pick apart their questions and at other times they backed off major areas of inquiry, such as pricing.

The government in court has alleged that, as a monopoly, Microsoft has the power to set prices in an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion. It has done so, the government says, in ways that favor companies loyal to Microsoft's chief demands and punish companies that cross its path.

During the trial, the government attempted to use pricing data to show that companies such as Compaq and Dell got better deals than IBM, a company with a checkered history with Microsoft.

But when Gates was asked about the issue on the third day of his deposition, the government still had not obtained detailed pricing information, and the questioning was not as lengthy as it was on other matters.

Gates testified that the prices Microsoft charges computer makers - on average about $50 a copy - can vary depending on how many copies the computer company purchases and other factors.

"It's typical that somebody with larger volume asks for and gets somewhat lower pricing than somebody who doesn't have high volume," Gates said. "There's not a perfect correlation to volume, but there is a correlation there."

Gates also said that it wasn't necessarily related only to volume, but also could deal with how well the company markets Windows.

"There are some things in terms of the relationship and marketing that I think IBM has been reluctant to do, so it may be that because of their view of those terms and their decisions on that, IBM may have a somewhat higher price than people with a similar volume. Although, you know, their volume is - nobody has the same volume."

There were no follow-up questions.

The document-destruction issue

In another line of questioning that seemed to go nowhere, Boies asked Gates about destruction of documents, particularly relating to the DR-DOS operating system, a competitor to Microsoft's MS-DOS.

Microsoft is being sued separately by Caldera, which holds patent rights for DR-DOS. The company contends Microsoft illegally used its market power to prevent DR-DOS' success.

Asked Boies: "Are you aware of any destruction or disposal of documents relating to DR-DOS?"

Replied Gates: "It's possible somebody once upon a time sent an e-mail message to somebody else that DR-DOS was part of the subject of that e-mail and then the person deleted that message."

Boies: "When you say it's possible that someone did that, were you involved in that, Mr. Gates?"

Gates: "I doubt that every e-mail message I ever received that had the word DR-DOS in it, that I choose to preserve forever after."

Carving up markets denied

Throughout the deposition, Gates repeatedly denied allegations of attempting to cut deals with competitors not to compete and to divvy up segments of markets to ease competition.

For example, Gates denied that Microsoft attempted to divide the market for playing audio and video with Apple. Although an Apple executive testified in the trial to the contrary, Gates said there was no attempt to get Apple to stop competing with Microsoft's products. Instead, Gates said, the two companies discussed making the technologies work better together.

"They wouldn't have to stop anything," Gates said.

Gates also denied making a similar offer to RealNetworks, despite pretrial testimony from Bruce Jacobsen, a top RealNetworks executive at the time, who told government questioners that Microsoft wanted RealNetworks to "cease to be a competitor."

The allegations - and those of Glaser at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he accused Microsoft of sabotaging Real's competing software - left Gates "confused."

Boies: "Did you consider that company to be a competitor of Microsoft?"

Gates: "I think I was confused about what RealNetworks - what their plans were, and I wasn't sure if they were a competitor or not."

Boies: "Was there a time when you did become convinced that they were a competitor?"

Gates: "Yes."

Boies: "When was that?"

Gates: "When Rob Glaser appeared in Washington, D.C."

The meeting with Netscape

Another alleged market-division incident got ample attention when Gates was questioned at length about a July 21, 1995, meeting between Netscape and Microsoft executives. Microsoft contends that the meeting was a benign attempt to develop a cooperative agreement; Netscape officials alleged there was an explicit request from Microsoft not to compete for browsers sold to users of Windows 95.

When presented with one particularly blunt e-mail written by Microsoft executive Dan Rosen about the meeting, Gates went to lengths not only to distance himself from Rosen's accounts but to undermine his credibility.

Gates' instincts seemed reinforced by Rosen's trial performance. Presented as the witness who would explain Microsoft's view of the June meeting, Rosen's credibility was called into question.

While Rosen testified that archrival Netscape posed no significant threat to Microsoft in 1995, Jackson repeatedly shook his head, asked pointed questions and expressed frustration as Rosen rattled off a series of statements that contradicted previous Microsoft witnesses, executives and Gates.

Rosen's e-mail that was brought up during the deposition seemed to buttress the government's case by summarizing the meeting's goals as establishing ownership of the Internet browser in Windows 95, having Netscape "add value" to other Windows products, and sending a message to the marketplace that Netscape and Microsoft were cooperating on Internet issues.

Asked if he remembered discussing these goals before the meeting, Gates replied simply, "No."

Houck then read this from the e-mail, in which Rosen quotes another Microsoft view of meeting - whether Netscape planned a head-to-head battle for the browser market, or whether Netscape would "build on top" of Microsoft's browser: "Chris Jones (Microsoft employee) summed up the purpose nicely: `We need to understand if you will adopt our platform and build on top of it or if you are going to compete with us on the platform level.' "

Gates denied that summary and pointed to a more benign view of the meeting:

"It says in the Rosen memo the purpose of the meeting was to scope out specific areas that the relationship between the two companies might take and to set in place a process to either conclude a strategic relationship or go our separate ways."

Another prickly exchange

Houck then asked what he remembered about the purpose of Microsoft executives attending the meeting.

"Well," Gates said, "there were no Microsoft executives in the meeting." The two then sparred on the meaning of "executives," with Gates saying that only vice presidents are executives.

Houck rephrased the question, asking the goal of "Microsoft employees who attended the meeting with Netscape on June 21, 1995?"

Referring to e-mail, Gates replied, "I can read to you from the stuff you've given me here."

Houck: "I don't want you just to read; I'm asking for your present recollection, if you have one."

Gates: "I don't know what you mean my `present recollection.' "

Houck: "As you sit here today, do you have any recollection as to what your understanding was back in June 1995 as to the principal purpose of the Microsoft employees in the meeting with Netscape?"

Gates: "I wasn't involved in setting up the meeting, so I, I can see what (Microsoft executive Tom) Reardon said here, I can see what Rosen said here."

Gates then said he had no view of what occurred. He added: "So usually if you have two people that go to a meeting and one comes back and says, `Looks great,' and the other comes back and says, `It doesn't look good,' my business experience is the person who says it doesn't look good is probably the one who has the most accurate view of the meeting, particularly when you're dealing with Thomas Reardon and Dan Rosen."

Define `definition'

The sniping was not limited to the government and the witness. Microsoft attorney David Heiner was featured in many of the nastier exchanges. At one point, Heiner jumped into a Gates-Boies spat and said: "Will the antitrust division of the United States, when it tries this case, present snippets and fragments as it did in the fall in the consent decree case?"

Boies replied, "One of the things about a trial is we both get our shot."

During the deposition, however, one thing Boies began to doubt was whether Gates would make his case in court by testifying. When Boies asked Gates if he planned to testify, he said he didn't know.

The transcript also is filled with the kind of quibbling over words already seen in the videotaped excerpts played in court. The semantic sparring reached an almost absurd level when, during questioning about a newspaper article in which Gates is quoted, Gates began debating with Boies over the meaning of the word "define."

"If you define `definition' for this conversation in a loose way, then I'll understand what you mean," Gates said.

Boies replied: "What you need in order to understand the question is to have me define what is meant by `definition'?"

Gates: "At least loosely."

Boies: "What I mean by definition is what you meant by definition when you said that you wouldn't have answered this question (from a newspaper reporter) unless you had a definition of a word."

They finally agreed that they could define "definition" as "common understanding."

Dogged questioning

Boies and Houck were just as obstreperous.

On the second day of the deposition Boies spent a long time going over allegations regarding Sun Microsystems - far more than the short excerpts played in court.

The government alleges that Microsoft licensed - and then changed, or "polluted" - Sun's Java programming language so that it would not perform the main function for which it was invented: allow programs to work on different operating systems without having to be rewritten for each.

The government contends that such changes were part of an illegal plot to maintain the monopoly Microsoft is alleged to have with its Windows operating system.

Boies repeatedly asked questions about an e-mail from Microsoft executive Ben Slivka in which Slivka described questions that Gates had posed regarding Sun's Java. "You had a lot of pretty pointed questions about Java. 1) What is our business model for Java? 2) How do we wrest control of Java away from Sun?"

Gates said, "I doubt I used words like that." Gates then explained that Microsoft was trying to develop a version of Java that ran better and faster.

After repeated questions about Sun and Java and the e-mail, Gates said, "I honestly don't know what you mean by `control of Java.' I know those words are in the e-mail from Mr. Slivka. But when you're asking me the question, I don't know what you mean, `control of Java.' "

After several more questions, Boies then said he would press the question another 30 seconds "and then I will stop." Despite the promise, Boies then proceeded to ask 22 more questions.

One of the most telling exchanges occurred on the first day, lending some insight into the ferocity of the words used throughout.

"Did you ever come to the point where you seriously reached the conclusion that Microsoft was likely to be put out of business by the Internet?" Houck asked.

The question seemed to elicit a fundamental truth of the Microsoft culture.

"Our risk of being put out of business," Gates said, "has been a constant feeling for me ever since we've been in business."

###########################################################################################

Q: By Mr. Houck: In or about June 1995, Mr. Gates, did you become involved in the planning for some meetings with Netscape? 
A: No.

Mr. Houck: Thank you. okay.

End of segment.


Q: The e-mail I want to ask you about first, Mr. Gates, is dated June 1, 1995, and the very top portion indicates that the bottom portion is being sent to you for your information by Paul Maritz, and the bottom portion is an e-mail from Thomas Reardon dated June 1, 1995, on the subject of working with Netscape. Do you recall receiving this memorandum or e-mail? 
A: E-mail, no.

Q: I apologize for using my old-fashioned terminology. You don't recall receiving this e-mail particularly? 
A: No.

Q: The e-mail states that,"Dan and Barb and I met late yesterday to review our recent discussions with Netscape and form our next few action items. Dan is meeting with Jim Barksdale, their CEO, shortly. Do you understand the reference to Dan to be a reference to Dan Rosen? 
A: Probably.

Q:	And is the reference for Barb a reference to-Barbara Fox'? 
A:	I mean, you could ask Thomas. Probably.

Q:	Do you have any understanding, sir? 
A: Based on -- I've never spoken to Thomas about this. I don't remember seeing the e-mail.

Q: Do you recall speaking to anyone about the meeting referred to here between Dan Rosen and Jim Barksdale? 
A:	No.

Q:	The e-mail goes on to list working goals which are: 
1. Launch STT, our electronic payment protocol. Get STT presence on the Internet. 
2. Move Netscape out of the Win32 Internet client area. 
3. Avoid cold or hot war with Netscape. Keep them from sabotaging our platform evolution."

Do you understand the reference to Win32 Internet client to be a reference to Windows 95?


A: No

End of segment.


Q: What do you understand it to be a reference to? 
A: Win32.

Q: Can you describe what that is? 
A: 32 bit Windows.

Q: Is Windows 95 a 32 bit Windows product? 
A: It's one of them.

Q: Were there any other 32 bit products in development in June of 1995? 
A: Certainly.

Q: Which ones? 
A: Windows NT.

Q: Do you know whether Mr. Reardon was referring to Windows NT and Windows 30 and Windows 95 or one or the other? 
A: Win32's a term that refers to all the 32 bit platforms.

Q: And as I understand your testimony, is that the 32 bit platforms under development in June of 1995 were Windows NT and Windows 95; is that correct? 
A: No. Windows NT was shipping and there was a new version that was under development.

Q: And Windows 95 was in development at this time? 
A: Certainly.

End of segment.


Q: In the portion of the e-mail denominated No. 2 which is, "Move Netscape out of Win32/Win95, avoid battling them in the next year, there appears the following statement in the second paragraph, quote,

"They appear to be moving fast to establish themselves in the value-add app businesd by leveraging Netscape itself as a platform."

Do you recall whether you agreed that that's what Netscape was doing back in June '95? 
A: At this time I had no sense of what Netscape was doing.

End of segment.


Q:Do you recall, as you sit here today apart from just reading these e-mails, anything that was reported back to you by any of the participants from Microsoft at this June 21st meeting? 
A:	Well, I think somewhere about this time somebody said to me that -- asked if it made sense for us to consider investing in Netscape. And I said that that didn't make sense to me, I didn't see that as something that made sense.

Q: Do you recall who said that to you? 
A:	It would have been probably suggested in a piece of e-mail from Dan, I think.

Q: Do you recall when you got that suggestion, whether it was before or after the meeting? 
A: Oh, it would have been after the meeting.

Q: Do you recall anything else that anyone told you back in June 1995 about the meeting? 
A:	No.

End of segment.


Q:	BY MR. BOIES: You are aware that it has been asserted that at that meeting there was an attempt to allocate markets between Netscape and Microsoft; correct, sir? 
A: My only knowledge of that is that there was an article in the Wall Street Journal very recently that said something along those lines. Otherwise, no.

Q: Is it your testimony that the first time that you were aware that there was an assertion that there had been a market allocation meeting or an attempt to allocate markets at a meeting between representatives of Microsoft and Netscape was a recent Wall Street Journal article? 
A: I'm not sure how to characterize it. The first I heard anything about that meeting and somebody trying to characterize it in some negative way was an Andreessen quote that was in the Wall Street Journal very recently. And it surprised me.

Q: Are you aware of any instanceB in which representatives of Microsoft have met with competitors in an attempt'to allocate markets?

MR. HEINER: Objection.

THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of any such thing. And I know it's very much against the way we operate.

Q:	BY MR. BOIES: It would be against company policy to do that? 
A:	That's right.

End of segment.


when you saw the Wall Street Journal article that talked about a May meeting in terms of allegedly market dividing conduct, did you try to find out whether there had been a May meeting between representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Netscape? 
A: Well, again, I wouldn't characterize the article in that way. When I read the article, what it said interested me enough and concerned me enough, I did seek to find out if there was a May meeting. But I don't think the article is what you're suggest -- said what at you're suggesting. I mean, we should get a copy of the article. I don't remember it that way. I remember Andreessen talking about how he had been in fear that Don Coerleone had come to see him. And, you know, once I realized that there was no meeting in May and that it wasn't - you know, that he after the meeting said he enjoyed the meeting and that it was, you know, just a group of our guys down there trying to talk about if there was any areas of cooperation, 'it seemed -- the whole thing seemed very strange to me.

Q: Did you talk to people to find out whether there was a May meeting? 
A: Yes.

Q: Who did you talk to? 
A: I consulted with my lawyers.

Q: other than consulting with your lawyers, did you try to find out whether there was a May meeting? 
A: Well, my lawyers then talked to all the people that might have met with Netscape, and I made sure they did that pretty broadly.

Q:	And you were informed that there was no May meeting; is that your testimony? 
A: That's the understanding I was given, yes. And then I was given some of the other information that I've already mentioned

Q:	But all that information came from your lawyers not from nonlawyer employees of Microsoft; is that what you're saying? 
A: It came to me through my lawyers.

Q:	Did you ever have a conversation with anyone in the last 12 months other than your lawyers concerning whether there were meeting in May or June of 1995 with Netscape, and if so, what happened at those meetings? 
A: Well, there might have been a point after I got all the data from the lawyers where I said to some of the PR people what an outrageous slander that article had been and how unfair I felt it was. And so I may have mentioned that to them.

Q: Did you have any conversations in the last 12 months with any person who was dealing with Netscape in 1995 about whether there were May or June meetings and if so, what happened at those meetings? 
A: No. I relied on the lawyers to go and meet with those people and gather the facts and educate me about was there a May meeting and what was the agenda or what was Andreessen's state of mind after the meeting, what did the notes look like. But that's all very recent. That is after the Journal article.

End of segment.


Q:Now, have you ever read the complaint in this case? 
A: No.

Q: Have you ever received a summary of the complaint in this case? 
A: I wouldn't say I've-received a summary, no. I've talked to my lawyers about the case but not really the complaint.

Q: Do you know whether in the complaint there is an assertion -- I'm not talking about the Wall Street Journal article, I'm talking about the complaint that was filed last May. Do you know whether in that complaint there are allegations concerning A 1995 meeting between Netscape and Microsoft representatives relating to alleged market division discussions? 
A: I haven't read the complaint so I don't know for sure'. But I think somebody said that that is in there.

Q: Did you find that out before or after the Wall Street Journal article? 
A: The first time I knew about these allegations was the Wall Street Journal article.

Q: That is, that 'Article preceded any knowledge that you had or didn't have related to the complaint? 
A: That's right.

End of segment.


Q: Have you ever had discussions within Microsoft about the desirability of trying to undermine Sun because of what Sun was doing in Java? 
A: I said to you part of our activity is to go out and work with customers to see what it takes to have them choose-to license bur products. And that's in competition with many other companies, including Sun.

End of segment.


Q: BY MR. BOIES: I'm not now talking about what you do in competition with other products or other companies. What I'm talking about is whether or not you've had discussions with people within Microsoft in which you talked about the need to undermine Sun, using those words, if that will help you, within Microsoft? 
A:.	I don't remember using those words.

Q:. You don't? 
A: No.

Q: Do you think you did use those words or you just don't know one way or the other? 
A:. I don't know.

Q: Would it be consistent with the way you felt about Java for you to have told people that you wanted to undermine Sun? 
A: As I've said, anything about Java you've got to show me a context before I can answer because just the term Java itself can mean different things.

End of segment.

Q: BY MR. BOIES: Did you have discussions with Apple in which you were trying to get Apple to agree to help you undermine Sun? 
A: There was some discussion about what runtime Apple would support, whether they would support some of ours or some of Sun's. I don't think I was involved in any discussions myself with Apple about that.

Q: Well, let me show you a document and try to probe what you mean by being involved. Let me give you a copy of a document that has been previously marked as Government Exhibit 265. 
A: portion of this document is an e-mail message from you to Paul Maritz and others and the portion I'm particularly interested in, and you can read as much of the three-line e-mail as you wish, is the last sentence, which reads, "Do we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun? Did you send this e-mail, Mr. Gates, on or about August 8, 1997?" I don't remember sending it. (The document referred to was marked by the court reporter as Government Exhibit 449 for identification and is attached hereto.)

Q. BY MR. BOIES: Do you have any doubt that you sent it? 
A: No. It appears to be an e-mail I sent.

Q. You recognize that this is a document produced from Microsoft's files, do you not, sir? 
A: No.

Q. You don't? 
A: Well, how would I know that?

Q. Do you see the document production numbers down at the bottom? 
A: I have no idea what those numbers are.

End of segment.


Q. Let me go back to the e-mail, Mr. Gates. What did you mean when you asked Mr. Maritz whether or not, "We have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun"? 
A: I don't remember.

Q. Did you personally participate in any conversations with Apple in 1997 and 1998? 
A: Of any kind?

Q. Let me be a little more specific. Did you participate in any conversations with Apple in 1997 or 1998 concerning what Apple would or would not do that would affect Microsoft competitively? 
A: Well, there were some conversations with Steve Jobs about Microsoft office and some and a relationship we formed around that and some other issues.

Q. And did you participate in those conversations? 
A: I talked to Steve Jobs on the phone I think twice.

Q. And what was the nature of your conversations with Mr. Jobs? 
A: Well, Steve had -- Steve called me up and said that he had become the CEO of Apple, sort of, and that Gil Amelio wasn't the CEO of Apple. And he raised the question of was there some beneficial agreement that we could enter into different than we'd been discussing with Gil. And it wasn't a very long call and the conclusion was that Greg Maffei would go see Steve.

End of segment.


Q. Was it your understanding that Microsoft office for Macintosh was believed by Apple to be very important to them? 
A: I really have a hard time testifying about the belief of a corporation. I really don't know what that means.

Q. Well, sir, in making the decisions as to what you would ask of Apple, did you believe that what you were offering Apple with respect to Microsoft Office for Macintosh was important enough to Apple so that they ought to give you something for it? 
A: I have no idea what you're talking about when you say "ask."

Q. Well, let me show you a document that has been previously marked as Government Exhibit 268. This is a document bearing Microsoft document production stamps MS98 0110952 through 53. (The document referred to was marked 169 by the court reporter as Government Exhibit a-66 f or identification and is attached hereto.)

Q. BY MR. BOIES: The first part of this purports to be a copy of an e-mail from Don Bradford to Ben Waldman with a copy to you, Mr. Maritz and others on the subject of "Java on Macintosh/IE Control." Did you receive a copy of this e-mail on or about February 13, 1998?
A: I don't know.

Q. Do you have any reason to doubt that you received a copy of this e-mail? 
A: No.

Q. The first paragraph reads, "Apple wants to keep both Netscape and Microsoft developing browsers for Mac -- believing if one drops out, the other will lose interest (and also not really wanting to pick up the development burden.) Getting Apple to do anything that significantly/materially disadvantages Netscape will be tough. Do agree that Apple should be meeting - the spirit of our cross license agreement and that Macoffice is the perfect club to use on them." Do you have an understanding of what Mr. Bradford means when he refers to MacOffice as "the perfect club to use on Apple."? 
A: No.

Q. The second sentence of that paragraph, the one that reads, "Getting Apple to do anything that significantly/materially disadvantages Netscape will be tough." Was it your understanding in February of 1998 that Microsoft was trying to get Apple to do something to disadvantage Netscape? 
A: No.

Q. Do you know why Mr. Bradford would have written this in February of 1998 and sent a copy to you? 
A: I'm not sure.

Q. Did you ever say to Mr. Bradford in words or substance in February of 1998 or thereafter, "Mr. Bradford, you've got it wrong, we're not out to significantly or materially disadvantage Netscape through Apple"?' 
A: No.

Q. Did you ever tell Mr. Bradford or anyone else in February, 1998 or thereafter, that they should not be trying to get Apple to do things that would significantly or materially disadvantage Netscape? 
A: No.

End of segment.


Q. What was Mr. Bradford's position in February of 1998? 
A: I think he had a small group in California that worked -- I'm not sure who he worked for. He probably worked for somebody who worked for Silverberg or -- no. No, I'm not sure who he worked for.

Q. Let's begin with what company he worked for.	He clearly worked for Microsoft; correct, sir? 
A: That's right.

Q. Do you know what his title was? 
A: No.

Q. Do you know who Mr. Waldman is? 
A: Yes.

Q. What was his title in February of 1998? 
A: I don't know.

Q. What were his responsibilities in February of 1998? 
A: He was he ran a group that was doing Macintosh software. Neither of these guys have a title like vice-president. That I can say for sure. They have a title like engineer or software engineer, software engineer manager, but I don't know their titles. They're not executives.

Q. In addition to you and Mr. Maritz, copies of this go to David Cole, Dave Reed, Charles Fitzgerald and Jon DeVaan. Do you know what Mr. Cole's position was in 1998? 
A: Yes.

Q. What was it? 
A: He was the VP -- actually, I don't know VP of what, but he was a VP working for -- I don't know if we reorganized by then. He was in Maritz's organization somewhere.

End of segment.


Q. And Mr. DeVaan? 
A: Mr. DeVaan was managing the overall office development.

Q. Did you have any conversations with anyone within Microsoft as to what position Microsoft should take with Apple in terms of what Microsoft should ask Apple for in return for Microsoft developing Mac Office? 
A: What time frame are you in?

Q. 1997 or 1998. 
A: Well, it actually makes a big difference. We reached an agreement with Apple in 1997 and there's no -- I'm not aware of any agreement other than the 1997 one. MR. BOIES: Could I have the question read back. (The record was read as follows: "

Q. Did you have any conversations with anyone within Microsoft as to what position Microsoft should take with Apple in terms of what Microsoft should ask Apple for in return for Microsoft developing Mac Office?") THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what you're saying about Mac Office. We developed Mac Office because it's a profitable business for us.

Q. BY MR. BOIES: Well, you threatened to cancel Mac Office, did you not, sir? 
A: No.

Q. You never threatened Apple that you were going to	cancel Mac office; is that your testimony? 
A: That's right.

Q. Did you ever discuss within Microsoft threatening Apple that you were going to cancel Mac Office? 
A: You wouldn't cancel -- no.

End of segment.


Q. BY MR. BOIES: Now, let me direct your attention to the second item on the first page of this exhibit. And this purports to be an e-mail from Mr. Waldman to.you dated June 27, 1997; is that correct, sir? 
A: The second one, uh-huh.

Q. You have to answer audibly yes or no,Mr. Gates. 
A: Yes, the second one. Now, in the second paragraph of this e-mail to you, the second sentence reads, "The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately." Do you see that, sir? 
A: Uh-huh.

Q. Do you recall receiving this e-mail in June of 1997? 
A: Not specifically.

Q. Do you have any doubt that you received this e-mail in June of 1997? 
A: No.

Q. Do you know why Mr. Waldman wrote you in June of 1997 that, "The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately"? 
A: Well, Mr. Waldman was in charge of this update. And the Mac Office product had been shipping for over a decade by now. And there was a financial question of whether to do this update and he felt it made good business sense to do it. Other people, irrespective of the relationship with Apple, had said that it didn't make sense to do the update. And so there was some mail from Ben, including this one, where he was saying he thought we should go ahead and finish the product. I'm not sure what he means about the negotiations with Apple. I'm not sure what we were negotiating with Apple at this point.

Q. Was this the time that you were negotiating with Apple to try to find out what you could get Apple to do to undermine Sun? 
A: Well, the only e-mail -- the only thing you've shown me where that term was used is after we reached a Mac Office agreement with Apple.

Q. You're referring to your e-mail dated August 8, 1997; is that correct? 
A: That's right.

Q. That has been marked as Exhibit -3-&5; is that correct? 
A: That's right. That's after.

Q. That's August 8, 1997? 
A: That's right.

Q. And it is clear from your August 8, 1997 memo that you are still attempting to get Apple to do additional things, is it not, sir? 
A: No.

Q. Well, sir, let's read it. It's only three lines.	You write, "I want to get as much mileage as possible out of our browser and Java relationship here." And when you talk about "here," you're talking about with Apple, are you not, sir? 
A: I'm not sure.

Q. Well, the subject of this is Post-agreement"; correct, sir? 
A: Yeah. That's what makes me think this was probably post-agreement.

Q. Post-agreement with Apple; right? 
A: Yes.

Q. So the subject is post-agreement with Apple, and the very first sentence is, "I want to get as much mileage as possible out of our browser and Java relationship here."	Second sentence says, "In other words, a real advantage against Sun and Netscape."	Third line says, "Who should Avie be working with? Do we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?" Now, do you have any doubt that when you talk about, "I want to get as much mileage as possible out of our browser and Java relationship here," you're talking about Apple? 
A: That's what it appears.

Q. Do you have any recollection of any discussions about the subje ct matter of this e-mail 1ine or about August of 1997? If the question is confusing, I'd be happy to rephrase it, Mr. Gates. 
A: Go ahead.

Q. Did you send this e-mail? 
A: It appears I did.

Q. Did you discuss this e-mail with anyone? 
A: I don't remember that.

End of segment.


Q. Let me go back to Exhibit 9-6- 6, which is the June 27, 1997 e-mail from Mr. Waldman to you. Do you recall -- and I know you've said you don't recall receiving this e-mail, but do you recall anyone describing the threat to cancel Mac Office 97 as a bargaining point that you had in dealing with Apple in or about June of 1997? 
A:	I remember going to meetings where Paul Maritz took the position that we shouldn't do the update, the Mac Office 97 update. And the main negotiation we had with Apple at that point was a discussion about a patent cross license. And so I said to Paul I wanted to understand better where we were on the patent cross license and understand the state of the Mac Office development. And then it appears that this is an e-mail that is coming after that meeting. I don't remember somebody using those exact words.

Q. Whether you remember somebody using the exact words that Mr. Waldman uses in his June 27, 1997 e-mail to you, do you remember people telling ou in substance that the threat to cancel Mac office 7 97 was strong bargaining point that you had against 8 Apple and that cancelling Mac Office 97 would do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately? 
A:	I know there was the internal debate about whether to do the update. And I know there was the patent discussion going on. And I said that. maybe even if it didn't make business sense to do the 14 date, maybe as part of an overall relationship with 15 the tent cross license, that we should go ahead and 16 do it. And so commitment to do the upgrade was one 17 of the things that we told Apple we might commit to as part of the patent cross license relationship.

Q.	And did you believe in 1997 that cancelling Mac office 97 would do a great deal of harm to Apple, as Mr. Waldman writes it would? 
A:	There was a question about whether to do the upgrade and whether it made business sense. I can't really say how much impact it would have on Apple of us doing the upgrade or not. Certainly Ben, as the person in charge of the upgrade, was very passionate about its importance and its dramatic nature.

Q.	My question to you now, sir, is whether you believed that cancelling Mac office 97 would do a great deal of harm to Apple? 
A:	Well, I know that Apple would prefer that we have a more updated version of Mac Office, that that would be a positive thing for them, and so that's why it was part of the negotiation relative to the patent cross license.

Q.	And did you believe that cancelling Mac office 97 would do a great deal of harm to Apple? 
A:	I told you I think it would be better for Apple to have everybody doing major upgrades like this.	I doubt -- I can't characterize the level of benefit of the upgrade to Apple, but certainly it's something they wanted us to complete.

Q.	The next sentence in Mr. Waldman's June 27, 1997 e-mail to you begins, "I also believe that Apple is taking this threat pretty seriously." Did someone tell you in or about June of 1997 that Apple was taking Microsoft's threat to cancel Mac Office 97 seriously or pretty seriously?: 
A:	Well, Maritz had taken the position	of it it didn't make business sense to finish this upgrade. And it's very possible Apple might have heard about Maritz's opinion there and therefore been worried that we, businesswise, didn't see a reason to complete the upgrade and that they would have the older Mac Office as opposed to this new work that we were part way along on.

Q.	Mr. Gates, my question is not what position Mr. Maritz did or did not take. My question is whether anyone told you in or about June of 1997 that Apple was taking pretty seriously Microsoft's threat to cancel Mac Office 97? 
A:	Apple may have known that senior. executives at Microsoft, Maritz in particular, thought that it didn't make business sense to complete that upgrade.

Q.	Mr. Gates, I'm not asking you what Apple may have known or may not have known. What I'm asking you is whether anybody told you in or about June of 1997 that Apple was taking pretty seriously Microsoft's threat to cancel Mac Office 97? 
A:	Those particular words?'

Q.	Told you that in words or in substance. 
A:	I think I remember hearing that Apple had heard about Maritz's view that it didn't make sense to continue the upgrade, but -- and that, you know, they wanted us to continue the upgrade. But I -- I don't remember any of the -- it being rased at all the way you're phrasing it.

Q.	Well, the way I'm phrasing it is the way that Mr. Waldman phrased it to you in his e-mail of June 27, 1997; correct, sir? 
A:	Well, in reading it, I see those words, yes.

End of segment.


Q.	Mr. Gates, Mr. Waldman on June 27, 1997, sends you an e-mail that says, "The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately. I also believe that Apple is	taking this threat pretty seriously." Do you recall anyone 
A:	Do you want to finish the sentence or not?

Q.	You can if you think it is necessary to answer	the question. Do you recall anyone telling you what I have just quoted in words or in substance in or about June, 1997? 
A:	No.

End of segment.

Q.	Okay. Let me ask you to look at a document previously marked as Government Exhibit 469. The second item on the first page of this exhibit purports to be an e-mail from you dated June 23, 1996 to Paul Maritz and Brad Silverberg with copies to Messrs. Higgins, Bradford, Waldman and Ludwig on the subject of "Apple meeting." (The document referred to was marked by the court reporter as Government Exhibit 260 for identification and is attached hereto.)

Q.	BY MR. BOIES:	Did you send this e-mail, Mr. Gates, on or about June 23, 1996? 
A:	I don't remember it specifically, but I don't have any reason to doubt that I did.

Q.	In the second paragraph you say, "I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship 1) Maintain our applications share on the platform and 2) See if we can get them to embrace Internet Explorer in some way." Do you see that? 
A:	Yeah.

Q.	Does that refresh your recollection as to what your two key goals were in connection with Apple in June of 1996? 
A:	First of all, June of 1996 is not in the time frame that your previous question related to.	And certainly in the e-mail to this group I'm not talking about the patent thing, but believe me, it was our top goal in thinking about Apple for many, many years because of their assertions.

Q.	My time frame in my question, sir, was a time frame beginning in 1996 when you began to view Netscape or the Java runtime threat as a competitive threat to Microsoft. 
A:	And that was after June of 1996.

Q.	Is it your testimony that in June of 1996 you did not consider Netscape to be a competitive threat to Microsoft? 
A:	Netscape was a competitor, but in terms of Java and all the runtime related issues, we didn't have a clear view of that at all.

Q.	So that -- I want to be sure I've got your testimony accurately. It is your testimony that in June of 1996 you considered Netscape to be a competitive threat but you did not consider Java or Java runtime to be a competitive threat; is that your testimony? 
A:	We considered Netscape to be a competitor and I told you earlier that until late 196 we were unclear about our position on various Java runtime things and what other companies were doing and what that meant for us competitively.

Q.	Do you agree that in June of 1996 the two key goals that you had in terms of the Apple relationship were, one, maintain your applications share on the platform, and two, see if you could get Apple to embrace Internet Explorer in some way? 
A:	No.

Q.	Do you have any explanation for why you would have written to Mr. Maritz and Mr. Silverberg on June 23, 1996 that those were your two key goals in the Apple relationship? A	They weren't involved in the patent issue at all. So when I write to them, I'm focused on the issues that relate to them. I do mention patents in here, but that certainly was the primary goal at this time and in subsequent times.

Q.	Let me be clear. When you write to Mr. Maritz and Mr. Silverberg, you talk about patents, do you not, sir? 
A:	Where do you see that?

Q.	Well, did you talk about patents? 
A:	Do you want me to read the entire mail?

Q.	Have you read it enough to know whether you talk, about patents?
A:	I saw the word "patent" in one place. If I read the whole thing, I can find out-if it's in other places as well.

Q.	You do talk about patent cross license, do you not, in this memo? And if you want to look at the last page, five lines from the bottom. 
A:	Yeah. They weren't involved in the patent issues at all, so it looks like in this mail I just mention that in a summary part, but it was our top goal in our discussions with Apple.

Q.	When you write to Mr. Maritz and Mr.. Silverberg, you don't describe that as your top goal, in fact, you don't-even describe it as one of your two or three key goals; correct, sir? 
A:	This piece of e-mail doesn't talk about the patent goal as the top goal. It's most likely that's	because the people copied on the mail don't have a	thing to do with it and I wouldn't distract them with it.

Q.	I want to be sure I have your testimony correct. In June of 1996, what was Paul Maritz's title? 
A:	He was involved in product development activities.

Q.	He was involved in product development activities.	What was his title? 
A:	I don't know. Systems.

Q.	Systems? 
A: Uh-huh.

Q. Did he have a title that went with that? 
A: Senior vice-president systems. I don't know.

Q.	Senior vice-president systems, I see. Did Mr. Silverberg have a position in June of 1996? 
A:	He worked for Mr. Maritz.

Q.	Did he have a title? 
A:	I don't know what his title was at the time.	He would have been an officer of some kind.

Q.	An officer of some kind. So you're writing a memo to Paul Maritz, a senior vice-president, and Brad Silverberg, an officer of some kind, and you're sending copies to four other people on the subject of the Apple meeting, and you say, "I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship." 
A:	That's quite distinct than any goals I might have for a deal with Apple. It says, "I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship," not "I have 2 key goals for a deal with Apple."

Q.	well, sir, at the bottom you say what you propose in terms of a deal and you talk about what Apple will get out of the deal and what Microsoft will get out of the deal; correct, sir? 
A:	Do you want me to read you the e-mail? 1 mean I don't know anything more than just what it says in the e-mail. I'm glad to read it to you.

Q.	Well, sir, does it say at the bottom of the e-mail that you are proposing something with Apple and you are identifying what Apple would get under your proposed deal and what Microsoft would get under your proposed deal? 
A:	Yeah, that's at the bottom of the e-mail.

Q.	In fact, the bottom of the e-mail talking about a proposed Apple-Microsoft deal, you say, "The deal would look like this," and then you've got a column "Apple gets" and a column "Microsoft gets" and a column "Both get"; right, sir? 
A:	I'm reading that.

Q.	Now, in this e-mail of a page or a page and a half in which you are proposing this deal, you describe your-two key goals as maintaining Microsoft's applications share on the platform and Apple to embrace Internet Explorer. 
A:	No, that's wrong.-

Q.	That's wrong, okay. 
A:	The word "deal" and the word "relationship" are not the same word. This says, "I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship."	This down here is an agreement which 1 thought we could reach with Apple.

Q.	Is it your testimony here today under oath that your two key goals in investing in the Apple relationship, which you mention in the second paragraph of this e-mail, is different than your two key goals in the proposed deal that you describe five paragraphs later? 
A:	I don't see anything in here about the key goals -- two key goals in the deal. I've told you that I'm certain that my primary goal in any deal was the patent cross license.

Q.	Mr. Gates, my question is whether it is your testimony today here under oath that when you talk about your two key goals in investing in the Apple relationship in the second paragraph of this e-mail, that that is different than what your key goals were in the deal that you proposed five paragraphs later? 
A: That's right. Investing in a relationship is different than the deal.

Q.	Now, you don't tell Mr. Maritz or Mr. Silverberg that your goals for investing in the Apple relationship are different than your goals in the proposed deal, do you, sir? 
A:	But the goals and the deal are quite different, so obviously they would have known they were quite different.

Q.	Well, sir, you say the goals and the deal are quite different. One of your two key goals that you talk about in your second paragraph is to get Apple-to embrace Internet Explorer in some way. And the very first thing under what Microsoft gets in your proposed deal is, "Apple endorses Microsoft Internet Explorer technology." Do you see that, sir? 
A:	Uh-huh.

Q.	Now, does that refresh your recollection that the deal that you were proposing had some relationship to the two key goals that you were identifying? 
A:	Some relationship, yes, but they aren't the same thing at all.

End of segment.


Q.	Then you said in your June 23, 1 996 e-mail, "I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship," you were talking about yourself personally; is that correct? 
A:	Yeah. When I say "investing in the Apple relationship," that means spending time with Apple and growing the relationship.

Q.	And when in describing the deal five paragraphs later the very first thing that Microsoft gets is, "Apple endorses Microsoft Internet Explorer technology," did that indicate to you that that was an important-part of what you were getting in terms of the deal? 
A:	No such deal was ever struck, so I'm not sure what you're saying.

Q.	Was that an important part of the deal that you were trying to get, sir? 
A:	We never got as far as trying to get that deal, unfortunately.

Q.	You never got as far as trying to get that deal; is that what you're saying? 
A:	No. Well, in this time frame Gil Amelio's total focus was on his new OS strategy, so what I outlined here we never got them to consider.

Q.	Well, sir, your e-mail begins, "Last Tuesday night I went down to address the top Apple executives;" correct, sir? 
A:	That's right. Q:	And down at the bottom when you're introducing the deal, you say, "I proposed." Now, you're referring to what you proposed to the Apple top executives, are you not, sir? 
A:	Yes.

Q.	Okay. And what you proposed was "the deal" that you then describe at the bottom of the first page and the top of the second page; correct, sir? 
A:	That's right.

Q.	And that was a deal that you proposed the Tuesday night before June 23, 1996 to what you describe as the top Apple executives; correct, sir? 
A:	I put forward some of those points.

Q.	Well, you put them forward and you describe them as proposing a deal, correct, sir? 
A:	That's how I describe it here, yes.

Q.	All right, sir. Now, you'd said that the deal that you were talking about never got done. Did you ever get Apple to endorse Microsoft Internet Explorer technology? 
A:	You're trying to just read part of that?

Q.	I'm actually -- what I'm doing is asking a question right now, sir. I'm asking whether in 1996 or otherwise, at any time did you get Apple to endorse Microsoft Internet Explorer technology? 
A:	Well, you can get a copy of the agreement we reached with Apple and decide if in reading that you think it meets that criteria or not.

Q.	Sir, I'm asking you, as the chief executive officer of Microsoft, I'm asking you whether you believe that you achieved that objective?
A:	We did not get some exclusive endorsement.	We did get some -- there's some part of the deal that to do with Internet Explorer technology.

Q.	Do you know what that part of the deal is? 
A:	Not really. It has something to do with	they will at least ship it along with other browsers.

Q.	Does the deal prohibit them from shipping Netscape's browser without also shipping Internet Explorer? 
A:	I'd have to look at the deal to understand.

Q.	It is your testimony sitting here today under oath that you simply don't know one way or the other whether le is today free to ship Netscape's browser without also shipping Internet Explorer? A That's-right.

Q.	When you identify things as key goals, do you typically tend to follow up and see to what extent those	goals have been achieved? 
A:	In a very general sense, yes.

End of segment.


Q. Did your goals change?	For investing in the relationship? 
A:	Goals for what? relationship?

Q.	You say in this e-mail you have two key goals for investing in the Apple relationship. one of 
A:	In investing in the Apple relationship.

Q.	one of them is to get Apple to embrace Internet Explorer technology in some way. What I'm asking you is whether that changed after this person got fired? 
A:	We re-evaluated all of our thoughts about working with Apple based on what the new management was going to do, whether they were going to target the machines, what they were going to do with their machines. Since they continued to say we were in violation of their patents, it continued to be our top goal to get some type of patent cross license. Mr. BOIES:	would you read the question back, please.

End of segment.


(The record was read as follows:)

Q. You say in this e-mail you have two key goals for investing in the Apple relationship. One of -- 
A: In investing in the Apple relationship.

Q. One of them is to get Apple to embrace Internet Explorer technology in some way.	What I'm asking you is whether that changed after this person got fired?") The WITNESS: You keep, either intentionally or unintentionally, trying to confuse MY goals for investing in the relationship with the goals we had overall for various dealings with Apple. Certainly the goals I had for investing in the relationship, that I had to start over and rethink because the investment was to spend time with the CEO who had been fired.

Q.	Mr. Gates, neither in this e-mail nor in any other document that either of us is aware of do you make that distinction that you're making now, correct? MR. HEINER: Objection.

Q.	BY MR. BOIES:	Do you understand the ion I'm asking? 
A::	This document does not say that my goals for dealing -- does not state my goals for dealing with Apple up here. It states my goals in investing in the Apple relationship, so there is a clear distinction right there in that document.

End of segment.


Q.	Mr. Gates, this document deals with a proposed deal	that you made to top Apple executives; correct? 
A:	That's only one part of what is in the document. There's a part where it talks about -- you never mentioned it, but the first goal is "Maintain our applications share on the platform." That's something I'm	doing in investing in the Apple relationship and that's not related to the deal that's given -- the proposed deal discussed below in the e-mail, so those are clearly two separate things. Related, but	separate.

Q.	What I think I've done is I think I have mentioned the first goal a number of times. 
A:	I don't think so.

End of segment.

A:	No, I don't recall that.

Q:.	The top e-mail, which is from Don Bradford to a number of people dated August 21, 1997 and is also on the subjecl; of "conversations with BillG last night," says that Mr. Bradford and someone else, Mohan Thomas, "will take the lead on working out the Apple bundle deal." Do you see that? 
A:	Yes.

Q:.	Did you instruct your executive staff in or about August of 1997 to work out an "Apple bundle deal 
A:	Well, I think this is post the August agreement,	late July or.early August agreement we reached with Apple. And I think there were some circumstances under which they would include or bundle IE with some of their shipments. I think that's what that's referring to.

Q:.	And is that what your present recollection is	-that you told-your executive staff in August of 1997? 
A:	Well, I don't recall specifically what 1 said to the executive staff about Apple, but it appears Ludwig took out of that that he was supposed to make sure that whatever outs that Apple had under the previous agreement for not shipping our technology, that we avoided those being a problem that prevented them from shipping our technology.

Q:.	Well, Apple wasn't prohibited-from shipping your technology in August of 1997, was it, sir? 
A:	No, I actually think if we -- I don't know the Apple agreement, I haven't read it, but I think there is something in there that if we got certain things done and if there were no problems and it passed tests and we were ready in time, that they would actually affirmatively include some of our technology in various OS releases. And this appears to be a discussion about whether or not we're going to be able to meet the requirements on us related to that.

Q:.	It is clear that getting the browser in the October OS release from Apple was something that, you, Bill Gates, and Microsoft wanted; correct, sir? 
A:	Yes, that's something that we wanted.

Q:.	The last sentence of the second paragraph says, "Bill was clear that his whole goal here is to keep Apple and Sun split. He doesn't care that much about being aligned with Apple, he just wants them split from other potential allies." And that relates to Java, does it not, sir? 
A:	I don't have a direct recollection, but if you read the sentence in front of it, that paragraph seems to relate to Java runtime.

Q:.	Do you have a recollection of telling your executive staff in or about August 21 that your whole goal with respect to Apple related to Java runtime was to keep Apple and Sun split? 
A:	No.

Q:.	Who was at this executive staff meeting? 
A:	Probably members of the executive staff.

Q:.	And who were they? 
A:	It's about 40 to 50 people. I doubt you want to take the time for me to guess. We generally get	about 70 percent attendance. Looking at this document, I think it's very likely that I was there and John Ludwig was there, but as to the rest of the executive staff, I'd just be guessing. It's very rare for	us to have non-executive staff members at those meetings, although sometimes it happens.

Q:.	Is Mr. Ludwig somebody who you believe is an honest and competent person? 
A:	In general, yes.

Q:.	Do you have any reason to believe that he would make up anything about what your statements were? 
A:	No.

End of segment.

Q:	Let me ask you to look at a document that has been previously marked as Government 58 This is an e-mail to you from Ben Slivka dated April 14, 1997. And the subject is, quote, "Java review with you," close quote. (The document referred to was marked as Government Exhibit 58 for identification and is attached hereto.)

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	Did you receive this e-mail in or about April of 1997, Mr. Gates? 
A:	I don't remember.

Q:	The e-mail begins that the author is working with Paul Maritz to set up a two -- to three-hour review for you on your Java efforts. Do you see that? 
A:	On our Java efforts.

Q:	On Microsoft's Java efforts? 
A:	No. I think it's Ben Slivka's group.

Q:	And he is a Microsoft group; right? 
A:	Yes. He's part of Microsoft but not all of Microsoft.

Q:	So you would interpret this that he is working with Paul Maritz to set up a two- to three-hour review for you of part of Microsoft's Java efforts but not all of Microsoft's Java efforts; is that what you're saying? 
A:	Yeah. The work his group is doing.

Q:	The work his group is doing on Java; right? 
A:	Right.

Q:	Okay. And he lists what he describes as some pretty pointed questions that you, Mr. Gates, had about Java Do you see that? 
A:	Well, I'm not sure those are the pointed questions. It says, "I want to make sure I understand your issues/concerns."

Q:	Well, that's actually the last part of a sentence that begins, quote: "When I met with you last, you had a lot of pretty pointed Questions about Java, so I want to make sure I understand your issues/concerns." That's what the sentence says; correct, sir? 
A:	Right.

Q:	And when Mr. Slivka says "I met with you last," he's talking about you, Mr. Gates; correct sir? 
A: Yes.

Q:	And when he says, "You had a lot of pretty pointed questions about Java," he's again talking about you, Mr. Gates; correct? 
A: Right.

Q:	And then he lists what he refers to as a start: 1. What is our business model	for Java? 2. How do we wrest control of Java away from Sun?" Do you see that? 
A:	Uh-huh.

Q:	Sometime prior to April 14, 1997, had you conveyed to Mr. Slivka that one of your pointed questions about Java was, quote, "How do we wrest control of Java away from Sun?" 
A:	I don't think I would have put it that way.	Certainly was an issue about the popularity of Sun's runtime APIs versus our runtime APIs.

Q:	Is it your testimony that you didn't raise the question of "How do we wrest ccntrol of Java away from Sun?" with Mr. Slivka? 
A:	I'll say again, I doubt I used words like that.	But there certainly was an issue of the popularity of our runtime APIs versus runtime APIs.

End of segment.

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	I take it you know Mr. Slivka? 
A:	Uh-huh.

Q:	You've got to answer "yes" or "no" audibly so the reporter can take it down. 
A: Yes.

Q:	And you believe him to be a person of competence and integrity?
A: Yes.

Q:	Do you have any reason to believe that he would have misstated what you told him when you met with him last before April 14, 1997?

MR. HEINER: Objection.

THE WITNESS:	In no way does this purport to be a restatement of things I said to Ben Slivk
A:

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	Well, Mr. Gates, what this memorandum says is, quote, "When I met with you last, you had a lot of pretty pointed questions about Java, so I want to make sure I understand your issues and concerns." "Here's a start, can you please add any that I'm missing?" And then he lists six, the second of which is, "How do we wrest control of Java away from sun?" You see that in the exhibit, do you not, sir? 
A:	Uh-huh, yes.

End of segment.

Q:	Did you have personally any discussions with Apple with regard to trying to agree with Apple as to the extent to which Apple and Microsoft would compete with respect to Apple's QuickTime software? 
A:	No.

Q:	Do you know if anyone from Microsoft had such discussions with anyone at Apple? 
A:	I know over a course of years we've talked to them about what their plans are for QuickTime, but that's all.

Q:	Does Microsoft have software that competes with QuickTime? 
A:	Since QuickTime's a free runtime, you could answer that either "yes" or "no."	It's not a revenue source for Apple. But there is an Apple technology that has some common things with some Microsoft technologies.

Q:	Do you believe that QuickTime software competes with any software distributed by Microsoft?

MR. HEINER: Objection.

THE WITNESS:	Depends on what you mean "compete."

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	Using that in the way that you would ordinarily understand it in the operation of your business, sir. 
A: No.

Q:	Did you make any effort or did Microsoft make any effort-to get Apple to agree not to market QuickTime in any respect or to limit the marketing of QuickTime in any respect? 
A:	There were discussions about whether we could help them with their QuickTime goals at various points in time. And, in fact, they encouraged us to do something where we'd actually by working with them make QuickTime even more popular than it 18. MR. BOIES: Would you read back my question, please? (Question read.)

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	Can you answer that question, sir?

MR. HEINER: Objection.

THE WITNESS:	I'm not aware of anything that was directly aimed at those things, no.

Q:	BY MR. BOIES:	Are you aware of anything that was indirectly aimed at those things? 
A: No.

Q:	Did, to your knowledge, any representative of Microsoft try to convince Apple not to sell or promote QuickTime for uses for which is	Microsoft promotes the use of NetShow? 
A:	There was some discussion about the future development of the runtime code and whether we could work together on the Windows side of that . runtime code that would enhance their goal and-our goals.

Q:	And was there a discussion in that context about Apple agreeing not to sell or promote QuickTime for uses that Microsoft was promoting NetShow to fulfill? 
A:	Not that I'm aware of.

Q:	Insofar as you're aware, did Microsoft representatives tell Apple representatives that if Apple would agree not to sell or promote QuickTime for uses for which Microsoft offered NetShow, that Microsoft would help Apple in other areas? 
A: Well, the Quick -- as far as I know, the QuickTime	runtime is free. So when you say "sell,"	I don't -- I'm not sure what you mean there.

Q:	I think I said sell or promote, I certainly meant to. But I will use the word "distribute,"	if that will help.

A: I think there was a technical discussion about whether a common runtime was achievable which would have enhanced their QuickTime goals.

Q:	When you say "a common runtime," would you explain what you mean by that?

A: I mean that-the Windows media player runtime would combine technology from them and from us that met all of their goals for QuickTime.

Q:	And so there would be a Windows media player that would be distributed, and Apple would stop distributing QuickTime for purposes for which the Windows media player was distributed; is that what you're saying? A	No. They wouldn't have to stop anything. There would just be a new runtime that might incorporate some of their technology and help them with their QuickTime goals.

Q:	Well, when you say there would be a new program that would incorporate or might incorporate some of their technology, would that result in them stopping the distribution of their existing QuickTime technology? A	There's no reason it would need to.

Q:	Was that part of the discussions? A	I don't think so. But as I told you, I wasn't part of any of those discussions.

Q:	Were you aware of those discussions while they were going on? A	I knew that Apple had a -- had the QuickTime runtime for Windows. And there was always a

Q:uestion of whether we-could create a Windows runtime that combined what their goals were there and what they had done well there for the work we were doing. And I know we talked to Apple about whether we could help each other in an effort like that.

Q:	When you talk about helping each other, would that result in a single product that would then be distributed in place of both QuickTime and- 1	NetShow? A	No. People could still distribute their old things. But if you create a new thing that's better, some people might use it.

Q:	Well, was the purpose of creating the new Windows media player that you referred to to obsolete QuickTime? A	Whatever functionality QuickTime had previously would be unaffected by any such effort.--

Q:	That really wasn't my

Q:uestion, Mr. Gates.	Maybe I can state it more clearly. Did Microsoft try to convince Apple to take actions which would have resulted in Apple no longer distributing QuickTime to people to whom Microsoft was	distributing NetShow or a successor Microsoft product? A	I'm not aware of anything that would have stopped	them from distributing the QuickTime they had. But it was possible we could come up-with something that would be helpful to both companies in terms of a product that took some of their technology and ours and	was better for users. ~

Q:	Did Microsoft offer to have Apple continue to offer a multimedia player for the Mac platform and	to assist Apple in that if Apple would agree	not to distribute that multimedia player for the Windows platform?

A:	As I said, I don't think there was any- discussions about not distributing some old thing, but rather a question that was could something new be created which	would be better for both companies.

Q:	Was the idea that once this new thing was created, the old thing that Apple was distributing would no longer be distributed by App1e?

A: As I said, I don't think that was part of the discussion.

Q:	Have you ever been told anything, or have	you ever	read anything about any contentions that Apple may or may not make concerning these discussions?

A:	No.

End of segment.

Q:	Are you aware of any assertions by Apple representatives that Microsoft representatives tried to get them to agree to divide the market?

A:	No.

Q:	No one's ever told you that; is that your testimony?

A: That's right.

Q:	And you've never heard that from any source?

A:	That's right.

Q:	Do I take it from what you said yesterday that if, in fact, Microsoft representatives had attempted to get Apple representatives to participate in a market division, that would be contrary to Microsoft policy?

MR. HEINER: Objection.

THE WITNESS: That's right.

Q:	BY MR. BOIES: And I take it that if you found out that people had done that contrary to Microsoft's policy., they would be appropriately dealt with?

A:	Yes.

Q:	Are you a regular reader of the Wall street Journal?

A:	Some days I read the Wall Street Journal.

Q:	Are you aware of a Wall Street Journal article that discusses assertions by Apple concerning alleged efforts by Microsoft to get Apple to agree to divide markets?

A:	No.

End of segment. let me just refer you to a Wall Street Journal article of July 23, 1998, entitled "U.S. Probing Microsoft's Multimedia Role." Does that refresh your recollection as to whether you ever saw a -- a Wall Street Journal article about alleged market division attempts between Microsoft and Apple?

MR. HEINER:	Do you want to show us the article?

MR. BOIES:	I have no objection to showing it. And I have no objection to marking it.

MR. HEINER:	I don't care if it's marked or not.

MR. BOIES: My purpose is just to try to refresh his recollection, to see whether he recalls having ever seen this.

THE WITNESS: No.
